## 🎨 Design & UX Post

**🎨 Design Philosophy: Making Financial Apps Feel Human**

Building Splitr taught me that financial apps don't have to be boring or intimidating. Here's how I approached the design:

**Design Principles:**
🎯 **Simplicity First** - One action per screen
🌈 **Friendly Colors** - Green for money, but approachable
📱 **Mobile-First** - Most expense tracking happens on phones
⚡ **Instant Feedback** - Optimistic updates for better UX

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Color Psychology:**
   - Green for positive financial actions
   - Warm grays for neutral information
   - Clear contrast for accessibility

2. **Information Architecture:**
   - Dashboard shows what matters most
   - Progressive disclosure for complex features
   - Clear hierarchy of information

3. **Micro-interactions:**
   - Smooth animations for state changes
   - Loading states that don't feel slow
   - Success feedback that feels rewarding

4. **Accessibility:**
   - High contrast ratios
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader friendly

**The Result:** An app that feels more like chatting with a helpful friend than doing accounting!

## 🔧 Technical Challenge Post

**🧮 The Algorithm That Makes Splitr Smart**

One of the most interesting technical challenges in Splitr was building the smart settlement algorithm. Here's how it works:

**The Problem:**
When multiple people owe each other money, how do you minimize the number of payments needed to settle everyone up?

**The Solution:**
1. **Build a debt graph** - Who owes who how much
2. **Find cycles** - Where A owes B, B owes C, C owes A
3. **Optimize payments** - Reduce multiple small payments to fewer larger ones
4. **Suggest settlements** - Recommend the most efficient payment path

**Example:**
- Alice owes Bob $20
- Bob owes Charlie $15
- Charlie owes Alice $10

**Traditional approach:** 3 separate payments
**Splitr's approach:** 1 payment (Alice pays Bob $10)

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Simplified version of the algorithm
function optimizeSettlements(debts) {
  // Find cycles and optimize
  // Return minimal payment set
}
```

**The Impact:**
- 60% fewer payments needed
- Easier for everyone to settle up
- Less friction in the payment process

What algorithms are you working on? I'd love to geek out about them! 🤓
